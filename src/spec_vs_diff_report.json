  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive backend logic fixes for both reset functions (nextDayReset and skippedDayReset) with proper strike count updates, includes a migration module to reset existing strike counts to 0, and adds frontend integration with two reset mutations and proper UI components. All three requirements appear to be fully addressed.",
