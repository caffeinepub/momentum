  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all requirements. The 'Reset New Day' button has been removed from the Header, replaced by a centered 'Start New Day' button that opens a dialog. The dialog contains both 'Next Day Reset' and 'Skipped Day Reset' buttons with clear labeling and visual distinction. The backend implements the resetSkippedDay function that unchecks all routines and resets streaks to 0. The frontend correctly connects the Skipped Day Reset button to the backend, provides success feedback, updates the UI, and closes the dialog after completion.",
