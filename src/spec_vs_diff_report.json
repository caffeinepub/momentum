REQ-2 is partially visible in the truncated MorningRoutine.tsx diff but the actual height reduction implementation is not shown in the provided content. No hallucinated features detected.",

      "reason": "The MorningRoutine.tsx file was modified but the diff is truncated. The visible portion shows component structure and handlers but does not show the actual container height reduction implementation (e.g., reduced height styles or className changes for the routine containers).",
