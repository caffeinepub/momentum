  "summary": "The diff summary is truncated and does not show any changes to the new-user provisioning flow or routine seeding logic in backend/main.mo. There is also an unrelated modification to project_state.json. Based on the provided evidence, the onboarding routine seeding requirements are not verifiably implemented.",

      "requirement": "On first user registration only, seed 3 routine items in Morning Routine (section=#top) and 3 in Evening Routine (section=#bottom) as normal routine items that are not auto-recreated on later logins.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet for backend/main.mo does not include the new-user creation/provisioning branch or any routine-item seeding logic; therefore this behavior is not evidenced as implemented.",

      "reason": "Although START_OFFSET appears in backend/main.mo, the diff snippet does not show it being used to set routine-item order for seeded onboarding items; deterministic seeding order is not evidenced.",
