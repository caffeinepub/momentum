All six requirements are implemented: a 'Reset New Day' button in the header, frontend-only check/uncheck with instant feedback, dynamic strike count badge preview (+1 when checked), a complete manual reset workflow, a backend function to handle the reset, and a React Query mutation hook. The diff shows evidence of all required features across the modified files.",
