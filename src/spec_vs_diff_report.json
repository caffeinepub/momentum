No unrequested features are clearly evidenced in the truncated diff summary.",

      "reason": "The truncated backend/main.mo diff excerpt only shows existing types and an addQuadrantIfMissing helper; it does not show any new-user creation lifecycle changes or list-seeding logic for “Week”/“Month”.",

      "requirement": "Ensure backend never auto-recreates “Week” and/or “Month” for existing users after initial creation (no per-login/per-fetch repair; deletion/rename persists; quadrant initialization does not restore them).",
