# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make routine containers more compact with scrolling and update the new day button label.

**Planned changes:**
- Limit Morning Routine container to display maximum 4 rows with vertical scrolling for additional items
- Limit Evening Routine container to display maximum 4 rows with vertical scrolling for additional items
- Change button label from "Reset New day" to "Start New Day"

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see more compact routine containers that scroll when there are more than 4 rows of items, and a clearer button label for starting a new day.
