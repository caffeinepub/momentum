# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve mobile device compatibility and make routine containers more compact.

**Planned changes:**
- Add safe-area padding to the header to accommodate iOS Dynamic Island and Android notches/punch-holes
- Reduce the height of Morning and Evening routine containers by 50%

**User-visible outcome:** The header will properly display around device cutouts on modern smartphones, and routine containers will be more compact while maintaining full functionality.
