  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 by adding a visual drop indicator line to task drag-and-drop reordering in both EisenhowerMatrix.tsx and CustomLists.tsx, matching the MorningRoutine.tsx pattern. TaskCard.tsx receives a data-task-card attribute for position measurement. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed: dynamic indicator updates on drag-over, clearing on drag-end/leave, consistent visual style, and coverage of both container types.",
