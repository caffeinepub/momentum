  "summary": "The diff implements optimistic UI for drag-and-drop cross-list task reordering. REQ-1 (1000-based ordering on drop), REQ-2 (background sync with rollback), and REQ-3 (no visual changes) appear to be addressed. The implementation adds calculateOptimisticOrder functions in both CustomLists.tsx and EisenhowerMatrix.tsx using the 1000-based method, and useTaskQueries.moveTask is upgraded with onMutate/onError/onSettled hooks. No visual changes are introduced. No missing requirements or hallucinated features were detected based on the available diff evidence.",
