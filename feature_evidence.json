      "featureTitle": "Implement cross-container task drag-and-drop between Eisenhower Matrix quadrants and custom lists. A task dragged from one quadrant or list to another should snap optimistically to the exact insert position chosen, with no status changes. On drop, update the task's container identity (quadrantId or listId, whichever applies) and recalculate its order value using 1000-based sparse indexing based on its new neighbors. Fire a backend sync call after the optimistic update; if the backend call fails, roll back the task to its original container and position. Routines must be excluded from all drag scopes — no dragging into or out of routine sections.",
